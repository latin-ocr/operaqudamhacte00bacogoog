raasson xxxvii

From these remarks it may be fairly inferred that
the fragment, now published, is a genuine portion of the
Opus Minus; that aster a brief survey of the Opus
Majus, similar to that which isfound in the Opus Ter-
tium, Baeon concluded the work with observatione on
the state of Latin literature, and ita prevalent defecta
agreeing precisely with that portion of the book pre·
served in the Digby MS. How much has been lost can·
not easily be ascertained. In the Opus Tertium, when
speaking highly in praise of Peter de Malum-Curia, he
remarks: “ No one can obtain the services of first-rate
“ mathematicians except my Lord the Pope, or some
'‘ other great prinae ; especially the services of him who
“ is worth more than any of them; of whom 1 have
“written fully in my Opus Minue, and shall write

“more in its proper placel' And again speaking' rn
the same work¹ of Magio: “This subjeetss' he says

“ia the most difficult of any in philosophy3 but
“in my Opus Minue, where I speak of the heavenly
‘⁴ bodies (achath) aud their influeuces, I have ex-
“ pounded these things at greater length; in thot
“ place, where Ι have touched upon the great secrete
“ of nature, which are not to he indiscriminately di-
“ vulged to all men”

No trace of Peter de Maiiam-Curia is to he found in
the present mutilated copy of the Opus Minue, and
very little notice of magic. The facsimile (B) may
perhaps lead to tho identification of the missing

portion of the work ; but after a eareful examination of
euch MSS. of Roger Bacon aa are accessible in England,
especially in the Bodleian Library, I have not been able
to discover any other copy of the Opus Minus.2 En-

p. xcviii. It may have perished in the Cotton lire.

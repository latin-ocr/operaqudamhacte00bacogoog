It does not, however, appear that he devoted the Compara·
same degree of labour and thought to logio aa hadid to ffi'fflss'm

other parte of philosophy. In hia Compendium Theologiae, ¹⁰85&
aa already stated, he professed his intention to enter on
the consideration of those verbal disputes which divided
thc Nominalists and the Realists of his daya; andin
the same work he hae devoted several pagos, as the
nature of his subject demanded, to the consideration of
the nature of words. But in none of these instances
has he entered on the subject of logio with the same
amount of care and interest aa on grammar, mathe-
matica, or experimenta] science. The reasons of thia
comparative indifference to the claime of' Aristotelian
logio are not difficult to divine. In the Opus Ter-
tium³ he states that the two great portale to science
are language and mathematica But aa for logie, he
says, that is of less consequence (aaa eat oia taam:

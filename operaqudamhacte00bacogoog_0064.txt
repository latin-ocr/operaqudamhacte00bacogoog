Euryalo broke more clearly on his vision, he resolved to'nnder·
ffiffl take a work more vast and complete than any he had
yet meditated. The words just quoted from the Opus
Tertium are important in this respect. They help ns
to understand the nature and course of the work he
proposed, and, in great part, executed. The MSS. of
the celebrated Dr. Dee, now in the Bodleian Librnry,
contain one portion of it, called hy its author compca-
dium Philosophiae.l (Digby, 76). Iu it Bacon refers
to a previous part under the title orornamenta Notae
acrama 'l'he same collection (Digby, 70) has fortu-
nately preserved this latter tractim, where we have a
description of the subjecta already discussed‚ and the
number of parts already completed. He had com-
meuoed the first division of the work with grammar
aud logio, and then prooeeded to mathematica “After
⁸¹ 1 have spokeu,’' he says, “of comparative grammar,
‘⁸ as valuable or necessary to the acquisition of know·

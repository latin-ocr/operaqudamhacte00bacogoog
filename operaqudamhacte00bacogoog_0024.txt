X Pheraei:

to entitle Compendium Philosophiae, for reasons to be
presently stated, no notice is to be found, with the

exception of two meagre and vague references made to
it by Jebb in the volume already referred to. It

appears from his statement, which will be considered
hereaster, that J ebb regarded the Compendium Philoso-
phiae as forming a second and enlarged edition of the

Min s.¹
‘ Opild remdve some of the misconceptions existing in

' reference to these trectises, and the many errors

occasioned by the variety of their titles, Ι propose
to give a brief account of their literary history.
The publication os the present volume supplies matc-
rials hitherto unknown to the biographers of Roger
Bacon, and more obvious means for correcting pre-
vious mistakes.

“the tongues and the sciences, presuming to make
“ translations''

So elsewhere in the Opus Tertium, speaking of
one of the schoolmen in great estimation at the
time, but whose name he forbears to mention, Bacon
observes :¹ “ The above-named incompetent author
“ has no mora real acquaintance with philosophy
“ than the rest of the vulgar. There are not five
“ men in Latin Christendom who are acquaintcd
“with the Hebrew‚ Greek, and Arabia grammar. I
“know them well, for I have made diligent in-
“ quiry on both sides of the sea, and laboured
“much in those things There are many persons
“among the Latine who ean speak Greek, Arabio,
“ and Hebrew‚ very few who understand the gram-
“ mar of these languages, or know how to teach them,
“ for I have put many to the test. For as the
“ laity speak languages which they have learnt,
“yet know nothing ol the grammar, so is it with
“ these men. Ι have seen many laymen who spoko
“Latin admirably well, yet knew > nothing of the
“ rules of grammar ; and so isit now with almost

= “all the Jews, and even the native Greeks, aud
“ not merely with the Latias who understand
“Greek and Hebrew. For aa the Jews and the
“Greeks have lost the wisdom of God, and with it
“ the wisdom of philosophy, there are very lew among
“them who can teach the grammar correctly, and -
“give the rules and the reasons of it, as we Latius
“understand our grammar hythe help of Priscian.
“And even when they do understand the lan·
“ guages, they know nothing of the sciences And
“therefore they cannot translate or do anything nse·
“ sul, or intermeddle in studies to any good purpose,
“although they may be apt and indispensable as·

·GRE.tT BRITAIN AND IRELAND
otrrro rus uronis sors.

Ox the 26th of January 1357, the ,lla-ter of the Rolls
submitted to the Treasury a proposal for the publication
of materials sor the History of this Country from the
Inrasion of the Romans to the Reign of Henrp⁸ l'lll.

The Master of the Rolls suggested that these materials
should be selected for publication under competent editors
without reference to periodical or chronological arrange·
ment, without mutilation or abridgment, preference being
giren, in the first instance, to such materials as were most
scarce and raluable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historical document
to be edited should bc treated in the same way as if the
editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps3 and for this
purpose the most correct test should be t'ormed from an
accurate collation of the best MSS.

To render the work more generally useful, the llaster
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give nn
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the work a brief
account of the life and times of the author, and any
remarks necessary to explain the chronology; but no other
note or comment was to be allowed, except what might be

necessary to establish the correctness of the text.

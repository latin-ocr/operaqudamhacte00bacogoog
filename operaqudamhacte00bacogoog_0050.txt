in the Sixth Error; a statement which corresponds
with p. 359 of the fragment3 that in discussing
this subject¹ he had followed the principles of Avi·
cenna, in his work Dc Auium amiciciam AEaipma;
that ho had exarnined tho Vulgata, and tho labours
of St. Jerome in the translation of the Scripturas,²
and had given instanoes of corruptions and mistakes
arising from ignorance of tho original languages,⁸ in
the Sixth Error. All these noticea agree minutely
with the fragment now printed from the Digby MS.

,ηε Tho references, made jn the fragment itself to the
¹²¹ Opus Majus‚ lead to the same conclusion. It speaks

of the first, fourth, fifth, and of the seventh part⁴ of
that work De Ira 3⁶ of the division entitled Scicratc'o
Euporimcatolts, and tho treatise on Optics (Perspec-
tc‘oo); of the remarks made upon Grammar in the first
part,⁰ and the praise of Mathematics m the fourth.⁷
The writer then adds.‘ ‘After reading what rs writ tten

“in this work, which I now send, Ithought fit to
“conclude with some observatione on the errors in
“the studies of the Lat tins, which are great, and of
“their remedies, which are atill greater3 and to
“ notify to your Excellence by what persona and by
“ what means all these things might ba accompliahed;
“ and this I do in the place specified, because this is
‘⁴ the final and priucipal use of my hook. And lest my
‘⁴ former work should be lost, through any dangers
‘⁴ on the mad, I have thought it right to keep the
“same end in view here, against all contingencies‚
“even as I have in this compendium abridged the
“ substance of the. whole of that longer treatise.”

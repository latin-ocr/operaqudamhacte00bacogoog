tenir, is evident from the whole course of his life and
writings. N umerous proofs ara at hand cf his great
regard for experimental philosophy. He considered it

as the only security against vagus theorias, the chief
remcdy for the errors in speculation and practice prc-

χ valentin his age. If the world loves to contemplata

the grem lord chancellor of James Ι. retiring from the
courtor the parliament to his museum at Grays Inn
or at Gorharnbury, laying asida his ¹chancellor's robe to
watoh the furnace or count the drops from the alemhio,

. the example of the solitary frier, with moro scanty

meana and fewer associates justifying the valae of
experimenta, in a darker and less favourable age, is
not less interesting. So lar aa the prize is to bs
given to ruere invention, Roger Baoon has superior
claime to Lcrd Bacon But as the discoverer of a
new mathod, which has changed the whole face of
sciense—(for he must he called a discoverer who vin-
dicatas a truth long forgotten‚ cr presente it in such
a light that all must sce and achnowledge its irn-
portance),-in this respect Lord Baoon will always
bear the palm alone. Roger Bacon did not live in
an age when the value cf Aristotle as the philosopher
ci nature could ba appreciated at its true worth. He
reprobated the mistranslations cf Aristode, but not
Aristotlc himself ; he thought there were treasures
still to be discovered in the books of his Physica and

’ Natural History, and that better translations and
more accurate texts would justiiy his admiration for ,

the great Greek toacher. He still adopted the older
distinctions of philosophy into pure and mechanical,
and he ranked under the latter division many of those
praeesses to which modern estimation has since given
a higher name. Though in his practice a keen and
sagacious experimentalist‚ in his exposition of scienee
he adopted the deductive in opposition to the induc-
tive method.

had nothing todo with thern. They were produced
by Bucon's great skill in mechanica, and his know·

ignorant and even the better inforrned surmised, molten
and forged in an infernal furnaoe. John Picus, the
celebrated count of Mirandole, and the glory of his
age, distinguishes between the two kinds of magio,

But to return. Many, as Ι have remarked, accused
Bucon, whilst thus employed upon works beyond the
comprehension of his age, of a compact with the Devil,

times Reuchlin, for his knowledge of HebreW, and
Budaeus, for his knowledge of Greek, drew on them-
selves the hatred and envy of foolish and unlearned
monks. So great was the ignorunce of the times that
it is not surprising if men living in such darkness
should attribute to demone the operatione of natural
bodies ; follies which disappear before the light of rea-

hostelries that the monks and friars could not believe
that any one could gain acquaintance with the learned
languages except by the aid of secret intercourse with

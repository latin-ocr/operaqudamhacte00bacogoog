“The second root of the difficulty rs that we ought

“only know what exista, original or translated, in
“connection with the sciencee,¹ but be able to make
“ additions to them, which is easy for good mathema

⁴‘ mutiriane, Master John of London, and Master Peter
“ de blebam-Curia, a Picard. There are two other
“ good ones, Mastar Campanus de N oraria, and Master
“ Nicholas, the toacher of Aumary dc Montfort¹ Por
“ without mathematice nothing worth knowing in phi-

“ pensable that good mathematioians be had, who are
“ very scama Nor can any one obtain their services,
“ especially the best of them, except it be the pope or
“ some grem prinoe. For he would hardly condescend

“ his own studies, and prosecute philosophicel investi·
‘¹ gations at his pleasure.

“And besides these expensas, other great expensos
“would have to be incurred Without mathematioel
“ instrumente no soience can be mastered3 and these
“ instrumente are not to be found among the Latius,

Some, in fact, imagined that Bacon was in alliance
with the Evil One, and that by the aid of spiritual
agency he made a brazsn head and imparted to it the
gia of speech3 and these magical operatione, as Bale¹
states by mistake‚ were wrought by him whilst he was
a student at Brazen Nose Hall Whether he did this
by the powers of natural magio is sor the present a

work on these subjecte, contende that Baoon was in-
debted to calestial influences‚ and to the power of
sympathy ior these operatione Το this he refers the
talking statues (statum Mercuriales) and the brazen
head fabricated by Bacon, or, as some essert, by Al-
bertus Magnus This was nothing else than natural

magio, in which Boethius was greatly skilled‚ and of
which he writes in these words to Cassiodorus :⁸ “Tuae

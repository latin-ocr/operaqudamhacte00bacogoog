How he extricated himselfI cannot say; certain it
isthat he complains to Pope clement IV. that he was
deprived of the ordinary aids of study, and his books
and writings taken from him “My superiors and the
‘¹ friars kept me on broad and water, suffering no one
“ to have aooess to me, fearful lest my writings should
“ be divulged to any other than the pope and them-
“ selves.''¹

pope sentior Baoon, and atter examining him on the
charges brought against him, committed him to prison
Thisis not at all probable, since the pope held Baeon
and his studies in great admiration, assisted him with
money, and advanoed the young man whom he sent,
John of London. But that Baoon was cast into
prison by Raymund, the general of his order,⁹ is
testified in a note appended to an ancient MS,
formerly rn the library of the Earl of Dorset· “Here

. “ and man3 because knowing not what is prior, they
“ must remam ignorant of what is posterior.-Wherefore,
“ through ignorance of this science, the ordinary natural
“ philosophy cannot be mastered‚ nor speculative and
“ consequently not practicol medicine3 not only
“ because natural philosophy and speculative medicine
“ are required for the practice of medicine, but
“ because all simple medicinas of inanimata things are
“ derived from this science. For neither the names
‘¹ nor the significatione of medicinas can be learned,
“except from this science; that is, from speculativa
“ alchemy, which speculates upon all inanimata things,
“ and the generatiou of all things from their elementa

“ There is also an operativa or practica} alchemy
“which teuchos man how to make noble metals
“ and colours, and many other things, better and
“more copiously by art than by nature. And this
“ science is more important than all that have pre·
“ cedcd, because it is productiva of more advantages. It
“ not only provides money for a state, but teaches the
‘⁴ means of prolonging life, so far as nature will allow
“ it to be prolongcd3 for we die sooner than we ought
‘¹ for want of a proper regimen in youth, and owing
“ to diseased constitutions derived from our fathers.
“But this twofold science of alchemy is scarcely
“understood by any ;⁴ for although many through-
“ out the world labour to make metals and colorus,
“ few know how to make colours truly and uscsully3
“scarcely any know how to make metals, and still
“ sewer to produce those things which avail for tha
“ prolongaticn os life. There are very few who can
“ distil properly, or sublime, or calcina, or resolve,
“ or perform other operations of this kind'’

He ought, then, in conclusion, and in conformity with
his design, to have treated of experimental philosophy
andos particular, thc sciences confirming by special

application the general and more abstract principles

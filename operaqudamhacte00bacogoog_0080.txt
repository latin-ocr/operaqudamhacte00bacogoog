“ lator, for translatore do not put into their texts
“ what they do not find in their originale. Seoondly,
“ it cannot be Aristotle's‚ or any wise man's3 for he
“who composed the work blunders in substance and

“ Besides, he investigates tho order of the sciences
“ efter his own method, in order to arrive at grammar.
“ But no grsmmmisn needs such nu arrangement in
“ order to treat upon grammar ; no grammarians do so,
‘⁸ nor ought they, as grammaria the first of all sciences
“ in the way of teoching Nor can upupil in grammar
“ understand the properties of other sciences, which are
“strictly posterior in order, end still less known to
“ him than grammar itself.¹ And therefore he is c fool
‘¹ who, in tecching grammar, begins with a division of
“ other sciences; and therefore Ι suppose that this is
“ not the work of a wise man, but of one who thought
‘⁶ that he knew more than he did know. And no
“ wisa man can doubt but that all which is there
“ soid of the division of the sciences, of the generation,
¹¹ power, and properties of letters, is either false, or
“ vain, or absurd. And this may be seen in my
‘⁴ treatise on Metaphysics, and other treatises upon
“the division of the soiences. Ishall not, therefore,
“ on this occasion discuss the division of the sciences,
“ as set down by this author, but in my Metaphysics
“ arrd elsewhere Ι have strangled all that is here
“ advanced, es foolish ond erroneous, and besides the
“ subject. It is the business of the natural philosopher,
‘¹ and metaphysician‚ and musician to explain the
“ rationale of the generation of sounds and voices,

¹1t would be well if modern grammon would observe this
compilers of English elementary cantion.

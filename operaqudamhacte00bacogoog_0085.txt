‘⁴ cf late been circulated among the Latina in a de·
“ factive and squnlid version. Nor is it surprising if
“ I say that thess books of logic are the best There
“ are four kinds cf truc argument ; two move the
“ speculative intellcct cr the reason, ac dialectics, by
“ a fceble and initiative habit, which is opinion, that
“ we may be disposed to science, which is a completo
“ and final habit, wherein tho mind rests in the
“ contemplation cf the truth. And this habit is not
“ acquired by demonstraticn.¹ But as the will or prac-
“ tical intellect is more noble than the speculative,
“ and virtuc with felicity infinitely excels bare sci·
“ snce, and is incomparably more needful to us, it ia
“necessary that we should be furnished with argu·
‘⁴ ments ιο raise and exorciso tho practica] intellect,
“especially aa we are feebler in this respect than we
“ are in speculaticn Willingly do wc taste of the
‘⁴ trae of good and evil; slow are we to toste the
“ trec of lise, to embrace the dignity os virtue with a
“view ιο future happiness. lt is necessary, therefore,
“ that the practical intellect should have its due aids
“ and be excited by arguments proper to itselfi as
“much as the speculative by its peculiar aids; and
“it is fitting, therefore, that there should be a
“ logie for morals and ιίιοοίοὲγ.2 For as speculativo
‘⁴ sciences have speculative arguments of opinion and
“ pure science, so tha practical scicnccs, as theology and
“ ethica, embrace those arguments by which mankind
“ are cxcited to practice—And these arguments in mat·
‘⁴ ters cf our well-being arc the strongcst‚ but powerless
“ in pure speculati0n3 as demonstrationis most effica-
“ cious in here speculation‚ but impotcnt in practice,
“ and in things which pcrtain to salvation. Logic

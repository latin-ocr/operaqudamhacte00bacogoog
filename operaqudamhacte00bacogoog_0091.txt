“ nomical instrumenta do not work except by vision,
‘⁶ in accordunce with the laws of that science. Nor is
“ it wonderful ir· all things ure known by mathematice,
“ and yet all things by this scienee (perspectiva), be·
“ museus I have said before, the sciences are intimately
“ connected, although each has its proper and pecu-
“ liar province But this scienoe has not hitherto
“ been read at Paris or among the Latina ; except
‘⁶ twice at Oxford in England ; and there are not
“ three persons acquainted with its power. He who
“pretends to be an authority (of whom I have
“spoken before) knows nothing of the power of this
“ science, as appears hy his books, ior he never
“ composed a book on this science, which he would ,
“ have done had he known it; nor in his other
“ books has he said anything about it They mu
“ but few who know these things, as in the case of
“ mathematica, and are not to be had, except ut
‘¹ great expense; aud so likewise are the instrumenta
“ of this science, which are very difficult, aud of
“greater cost than the instrumente needsu] for ma-
“ thematioe.''

“I say this,'’ he remarks in conclusion, “ because
“ I am sorry for his ignorance and that of tho
“ generality; for without these they can know
“ nothing. No author among the ancient masters οι·
“ the moderna has written about them; but 1 bavo
“ laboured at them for ten years, as fur as I could
“find time, and I have examined them narrowly us
“ well as I could, reduciug them to writing since
“ the time when I received your mandate.”¹

present, therefore, Ι content myself with the account
of him given by Wood in his Antiquities of the
University of Oxford, only eorrecting in the notes
the obvious mistskes of this intelligent entiquery

⁸ Wood's narrative contains almost nll thet is known

with any eertsinty on the subject. It has the advan-
tage, besides, of being derived from a eareful pemsal of
Baeon's MSS, some of which have sinee disappeared‚
and others been destroyed by the lire in the Cotto-
nian Library.

Long as this prefaee is, I cannot close it without
aeknowledging my numerous obligations to the mem·
bers of both Universities. To the master and fellows
of University College, Oxford, to the president and
follows of Corpus Christi College in the same Uni-
versity, to the master and follows of Trinity, to
the Soeiety of Peterhouse, in the University of cam<
bridge, Ι sm indebted for the loan of various MSS. ,
of Roget Bneon Το the Rev. H. Lusrd, fellow of

Trinity Oollege, Cambridge, I owe many thanks for
his kind investigations made st my instance in tho
librsries of his University. Το R. B. Knowles, Esq,
of the Middle Temple, I heg to testify my gratitudo ’
for his ready and efficient help, and his constent

friendship.

‘·' may see who inspecta the Cotton MS. (Opus Minus
“ cap. 1. MS. Oot. Tib. Ο. v. f. 121.)

“ In the MS. of the King's Library a treatise is to be
“ found entitled Liber Naturalium Ropcri Baaoa, ‹alled
“ by Leland and others Communia Naturalia Plato
“ sophia. That this is a third part of this Opus Minus
“ may be inserted from what is stated in the first
‘⁴ chapter. ‘After I have spoken of grammar in relation ⁴
“ ‘to divers languugcs, as they are important, yse,
“ ‘necessary for study to the Latius, and finished my
“ ‘observatione on Logia, and in the 'second volume
“ ‘have treated of the different parts of Mathematios;
“ ‘now in the third place comes Natural Philosophy,
“ ‘to which Metaphysics and Morals shall be joined in
‘⁴ ‘the fourth! This is the order which Bacon says he
‘⁴ should observo in his Opus Minus. So, if Ι mistake
“ not, this work will contain the following books :-

“ l. Dc Suorma Grammaticali.

“ 2. De Corrstructioae Partiam.

“ 3. lle topica.

“ h. De Laudibus Artis Mathematiccc.

“ 5. Commum‘a Naturalis Philosophia.
“ 6. Da Mataphysica.

“ 7. De Intellecta ct forsan Intelltptbtltst
“ 8. De Universalihae.”

J ebb's assumption that the Opus Minus embraced such Not in ae·
a range of subjecte ns is here set down, either in its menae
first, or what is assumed to be its altered form, is atB ⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰
varianae both with Bacon’s own statements oi the nature ffflssiiss
of his work and the internal evidence of the treatise ⁰⁰¹¹¹⁶¹¹¹t
to which Jebb refers. Bacon assera distinctly that he
had composed the Opus Minus, or Secunde Scriptura,

to serve as en abstract and specimen of his greater

¹1r should be intelliqrrlr'a. See p. lxxii.

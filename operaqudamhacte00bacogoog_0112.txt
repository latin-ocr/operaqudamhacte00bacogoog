After stating that Paul of Middleburg, who hed
induced Oopemicus to turn his attention to this sub· 1
ject, had stolen half his work on the due observetion
of Easter from Roger Bonan, Anthony Wood thus
concludes with some remarks on Beoon's writings

1. Ι suspect, he says, that even the titles of many of
the books which Baoon eomposed have been lost, and
the copies of those which remain cannot be found with-
' out extreme difficulty. Their existence is not known
through the envy or ignorance of their possessore.2

2. The works of Bacch which are generally found,
are deficient in many places or else redundant; and
this may be said of those which are reekoned perfect.
Certainly in his work De Utilitatc »fricationem there
occurs a question (not to mention other instances):
Utrum intellectus agene att pare aninam ; in the
discussion of which the writer asserta that the affirma·
tion is agreeable to the teaching of Aristotle, and was
held in his time by Rohert Orostete and Adam de
Marah, and that he had heard William of Auvergne,
bishop of Paris, maintain the negative. This occurs
in the copy of the same work³ in the library of
Sir Robert Ootton; and yet in a copy of thesemo
ormerly belonging to Thomas Allen, and now among
the Digby MSS„ not a word of this is to be found
Shall Ι fmther add, that the same work, which in the

Cotton Library is entitled De U tilitatc Sciattc‘aram, is

ιῙιι Opere Minore ad Clemen- ¹[“Itiseuier‚”mys1aelaud“to
tem IV. [This passage does not “ collect the leaves of the Sibyl

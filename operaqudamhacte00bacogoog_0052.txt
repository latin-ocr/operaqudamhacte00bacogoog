tire books and copious extracts from the Opus Majus
may be found in every great library. Not so the
Opus Minus It was comparatively unknown.

'l'he evidence, already sufficiently strong to sub-
stantiale the authenticity of this fragment, may be
closed by two observatione: first, that the same young
man, juvenis Jobosmtes,¹ is mentioned as having been
sent with the work to explain its difficulties and ex·
hibit certain experimenta, aa in the Opus Majus² and
the Opus Tertium ; and, secondly, that like these two
works, and unlike any other of Becon’s works. it was
addresaed to the pope.a These arethe macons which
have induced me to ascribe this fragment without
hesitation to Roger Baccn, and affix to it the title
oi the Opus Minus. The necessity for entering thus
minutely upon the identification of the work, besides
the desire of removing longestoblished errore, will
more fully appear in the sequel⁴

The same year which produced the Opus Minus
gave birth to ’ the Opus Tertiurn Much that might
have been said of the matter and objecto of this
trectise has been anticipated already. It has been
frequently cited by J ebb in his preface to the
Opus Majus, and from it he derived the most striking
incidente of Bacon's history. Four original MSS. of
this work at least are known to exist3 but none of
au carly date; one at Douai has been described
in debui by the veteran philosopher Victor Oousin,

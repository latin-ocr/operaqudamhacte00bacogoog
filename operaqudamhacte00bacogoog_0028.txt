No legal son of the Holy Sec, if he would retain its
bleoeing ond his birthright, might contract affinity with

But this enduring displeasure of the pope towards

time he appears to have contractcd with Roger Bacon.
Unlike Grostete and Adam de Marisco, Bucon's brothers,
all his family, and even the philosopher himself (so

were zealous adherente to the royal carrae. They had
sacrificed their fortunas (and they were evidently a
wealthy family) in behalf of the party they had es·
poused; more than once they had drawn upon them-
selves the resentment of the victorious barons.2 The
political sacrifices, therefore, of Roger Bacon‚ not less
than his philosophical deserte, would serve to recom-
